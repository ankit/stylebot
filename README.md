### Stylebot

A Google Chrome extension that allows users to manipulate a web pageâ€™s appearance in a WYSIWYG manner.

Using Stylebot, users are able to:

1. Incrementally build custom stylesheets for Chrome.
2. Save custom CSS rules for sites. The next time they visit a site, their custom CSS is already applied.
3. Share, explore and apply CSS created by other users via [Stylebot Social](http://stylebot.me).

### About

This project began as a Google Summer of Code 2010 project, where I was mentored by Rachel Shearer.
I have since continued to maintain it and build new features.
Along the way, few people have contributed new features and bugfixes.
