###Stylebot

A Chrome extension to allow users to adapt the web's appearance to their preference by creating custom CSS. It aims to improve the accessibility and adaptability of the web, both for users who're not familiar with CSS and advanced CSS users.

Using Stylebot, users will be able to:

1. Incrementally build the custom stylesheet for Chrome.
2. Save custom CSS rules for a site / group of sites, so that the next time they visit it, their custom CSS is already applied.

###Share Styles

You can browse styles created by other users and share your own on [Stylebot Social](http://stylebot.me).

###Installation

Google Chrome: [https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha)
